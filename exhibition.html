          <h3>Explore the wonders of our cosmos</h3>
          <p>
            Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the
            universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit
            about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by. Follow the journey of our solar exploration:
            from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar
            system.

          <h3>Biology and Medicine</h3>
          <p>
            From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into
            the great wonders of the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality
            of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we
            explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of
            penicillin and the first heart transplant.

          <h3>Evolution</h3>
          <p>
            For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come
            from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for
            exploring and understanding our place in this world. Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the
            species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who
            didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.
